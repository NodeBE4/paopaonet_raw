<p><span>经济社会学家斯塔克说「搜索是信息时代的标志」。谷歌只是一家公司，而搜索是个更广义的概念，它已经无处不在。基于搜索自身的优势，它经常能主导思维懒惰者的意识，不仅影响着人们对世界的认识，</span><span>甚至越来越多的影响着现实生活，政治和经济</span><span>。</span></p>
<p><span>搜索的优势不必赘述，而它的阴暗面也正在逐步进入人们的思考。</span></p>
<p><span>媒体巨头可以通过个性化的推送平台为你筛选信息，但它们是如何对这个复杂的世界进行精简的呢？一篇报道能否被定义为「热门」是基于新闻机构的统计数据、还是企业独有的运算程序做出的选择？如果是统计数据，那么根据又是什么呢，转载量、所属机构权威性，还是其他未知因素？</span></p>
<p><span>为了在搜索引擎中排到前列，许多商家在暗中付费，这早已是公开的秘密，如果按照这个逻辑，大型互联网公司是有能力在新闻报道或者政治活动中进行操控的。比如是否有人在引导读者和志愿者的行为？或者通过某种算法来提升预期目标的搜索热度？</span></p>
<p><span>搜索引擎有权对信息条目进行收纳、过滤和排名，从而快速决定哪些话题可以成为长久的公众焦点、哪些话题只能转瞬即逝。搜索服务声称在为人们展示「世界的全貌」，但其实这个世界是由算法创造出来的。</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>「更好的用户体验」是各大互联网公司采取一切行动的理由，但可以确定的是，有些时候这些公司会与我们发生利益冲突，它们的决策过程被科技手段和定型契约所掩盖，用户根本无从了解。</span></p>
<p><span>每个网络公司都有设置对不合法内容的公开指导原则，但它们如何应用这些原则却不为人知。如果是在党管一切的中国大陆，用户已经不再关心那些明文规则了，事实证明，</span><span>一切结果将由政府的审查部门、加上网络公司的自我审查程度来决定。</span></p>
<p><span>国际大牌企业也并非乌托邦，科技爱好者肯定了解一则曾经影响力很大的新闻：</span><span>2012</span><span>年，纽约大学的研究生在美军大规模开展无人机战争期间开发了一款无人机程序</span><span>Drones+</span><span>应用，该程序可以将新闻报道中的无人机攻击目标进行汇总，然后在地图中标注出来，并以弹出信息的形式对最新的袭击事件予以提示。但苹果公司认为该程序涉及内容太具有争议性而不能通过上架审核。美国媒体指责，苹果公司曾经批准过很多描述新闻报道中破坏性事件的应用程序，拒绝</span><span>Drones+</span><span>的理由并不充分，但苹果依旧撑了两年不改决定。在第五次被驳回申请后，开发者不得不将软件名「无人机」改为了「元数据（</span><span>Metadatat</span><span>）」，并删除了描述中的所有「无人机」字样，如此才得以令该应用进入</span><span>App Store</span><span>。但需要这一信息的用户却很难再通过搜索找到它了。</span></p>
<p><span>商业上成功的网络公司在赛博空间拥有了几乎无可想象的权力，尤其是在对内容的操控方面。被<a href="https://pao-pao.net/search/node/%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C%E7%AE%A1%E5%88%B6" rel="nofollow"><span>中国当局视为首要关键的网络管制</span></a></span><span>最先拿下的是国内大牌网络服务公司</span><span>，用不断加强的管制条例（大棒）和人为的不平等竞争环境（胡萝卜），来让这些国家局域网</span><span>“</span><span>巨头</span><span>”</span><span>乖乖当枪。</span></p>
<p><span>搜索引擎制造商不会披露搜索排名方法的细节，它只是勾勒出一个轮廓：排名根据的是相关性和重要性，链接到某一特定页面的网页越多，搜索就会认为该页面更有权威性</span><span>——</span><span>排名结果是通过加权投票得出的，是平等主义（任何人都可以链接）和精英主义（有些链接更加有效）的结合体。</span><span>当后者被当权者控制时，前者便形同虚设。</span></p>
<p><span>用户享受服务是免费的，互联网公司数千工程师的工资要来自于广告商</span><span>——</span><span>那些渴望借助这一平台寻找到目标客户的市场营销人员。用户付出的是精力和数据，这些都变成了市场营销的原材料。于是，</span><span>与其说我们是网络公司的客户，还不如说是它们的产品</span><span>。</span></p>
<p><span>尤其是在<a href="https://pao-pao.net/search/node/%E5%A4%A7%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE" rel="nofollow"><span>大数据技术正在引领利益最大化的时代</span></a>里，各行各业都在热情地投入挖掘数据大潮中，搜索行业自我标榜的「争取用户」和「同意收集」已经有些令人怀疑了。不过进化也随之而来，声称「不会追踪你」的</span><span>DuckDuck-Go</span><span>搜索引擎可以让用户选择适合自己的隐私等级，不过次级链接就不保了。</span></p>
<p></p><div class="media media-element-container media-full"><div class="ds-1col file file-image file-image-jpeg view-mode-full clearfix">

  
  <img height="243" width="480" class="media-element file-full" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://files.pao-pao.net/sites/pao-pao.net/files/styles/large/public/duck.jpg?itok=cHwYSfDE" alt="" title="" /></div>

</div>
<p>隐形营销得以生存全凭来自直觉的信任。在利益面前，网络公司可以弱化付费内容和免费内容的视觉差别，当某些信息最终出现在搜索页面前列的时候，用户已很难区别这是品质排名还是竞价的结果。</p>
<p><span>社交网络也一样，</span><span>用户无法知道为什么某些报道、程序和书籍会荣登推荐列表，尊重商业策略的保密是应该的，但也正是这种不可测性让很多投机行为、剥削行为和误操作得以不为人知</span><span>。</span></p>

<p><span>2</span><span>012</span><span>年</span><span>Facebook</span><span>推出了一项服务，让普通用户都可以通过付费来推广自己的帖子，还价格不菲。当一些付了钱的用户发现他们的帖子忽然间被人视而不见时，质疑声和批评声随之而来。</span><span>Facebook</span><span>没有披露如何对用户的动态信息加以分类和整理的，人们不了解</span><span>“</span><span>边际排名</span><span>”</span><span>的运作方法，也就无法评估这一问题的实际影响。渴望成为网红的草根用户在积极地研究自我营销方式、希望从那些成功案例中寻找到经验，他们尚且没意识到</span><span>还有不少更加根源的</span><span>“</span><span>为什么</span><span>”</span><span>。</span></p>
<p><span>社交应用不仅是根据用户个人喜好定制的广播，还可以从用户那里查询新闻和言论，</span><span>Twitter</span><span>和它的抄袭者大陆微博都有个标签功能</span><span>#</span><span>，可以帮助使用者随时构建一个话题社区。</span><span>#</span><span>符号能让某些词语变得非常热门，不仅订阅者可见，还可以推荐给广大的用户，但其推广原则却不为用户了解。</span></p>
<p><span>中国大陆的微博最常见的现象</span><span>是，在当局认为敏感的话题中即便使用标签搜索、该标签进入热点排名，用户也一样很难查到部分更坚定的政治反对声音。为了维护活跃的表象，微博已减少删帖量，更频繁采取的是「降级处理」，也就是令政治反对和深入思考的内容可见度大幅下降、自动拒绝转发评论，或者干脆只有博主自己可见。曾做过大陆门户网站编辑的内部人士透露，他们经常被要求按审查指令修改标签可见度和「搜索联想」。</span><span>我们印象中墙内外的平行世界观感，有些时候可能只是个表面的假象。</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>媒体研究学者</span><span>Gliiespie</span><span>曾在博文中写道：越来越多的公众言论发表在某些特定的私人信息平台和社交网络上，同时这些平台的提供者依靠复杂的算法对收集到的大量内容进行管理、整理和组合，这一过程中，人们对这些算法的期待、与它们真实呈现出来的结果发生了严重的偏离</span><span>……</span><span>问题不在于公正的平台操作，而在于媒体的解读，</span><span>人们对热门话题的概念存在误解</span><span>。</span></p>
<p><span>对搜索文化重新进行思考是必要的。首先，对于搜索巨头和内容制造商的贡献应该实事求是的评估，令中间商收入趋于合理化。再有，我们早前提到过<a href="https://pao-pao.net/article/681" rel="nofollow"><span>互联网创造了新的等级制</span></a>这一问题，当权力和金钱集中到极少数人手里时，大众是应该保持警惕的，经济领域只是其中一方面，另有媒体多样性、观点独立性，以及权利和机会在个体间的分布状况等重要问题。</span><span>如果不做这些分析就去判定互联网是民主多元的世界，会有武断之嫌。</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span>搜索引擎的确令混乱而庞大的信息流变得井然有序，但它也滋生了模糊营销、不公平竞争和现实畸形问题。互联网正急速发展，情境不断更新换代，分析总是滞后的，但只要去思考和应对就应该为时不晚。在极权国家里，民众没有语话权，于是你能做的就只剩下一点了</span><span>——</span><span>在民主实现之前</span><span>放弃国产应用</span><span>。</span></p>
